    Microwave Oven not only provides a different way of cooking, but
    it also brings out people's inner chefs. It uses microwave
    radiation to cause atomic movement in water, fat, sugar
    molecules, etc. to cook the food. Thatâ€™s why it is faster than
    normal cooking. But Servicing and repairing a microwave oven
    might be a headache, especially if you work on a busy schedule.
    Finding microwave repair experts is indeed difficult and
    time-consuming. We don't want you or your everyday routines to
    suffer because of a faulty microwave. */}

            {" "}
            If you can see visible sparks inside the microwave oven during its
            operation, you have to cut its power off immediately. The cause of
            visible sparks can be due to waveguide cover damage, burned diode
            out, or other issues. These kinds of issues should be handled by
            only professionals. Smartcare Repair And Services have experienced

            The microwave oven seems operating but is not producing enough heat

            Sometimes microwave oven operates independently by switching the
            on/off button by itself. This is caused by various reasons like a
            defect in the diode (Triac), improper functioning of the control
            panel, or if the switch gets stuck. You can give us a call at
